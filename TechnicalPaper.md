# NoSQL

NoSQL, also known as “**not only SQL**”, is a database design method that allows you to store and query data outside of the traditional relational database structure. By using this we can more easily manage and develop many different forms of data structures. NoSQL databases are generally best for storing and modelling structured, semi-structured, and unstructured data in one database.
