# NoSQL

## What is NoSQL?

NoSQL refers to non-relational databases, also known as “**not only SQL**”, is a database design method that allows you to store and query data outside of the traditional relational database structure. By using this we can more easily manage and develop many different forms of data structures. NoSQL databases are generally best for storing and modelling structured, semi-structured, and unstructured data in one database. Some of the common NoSQL databases include MongoDB, Apache Cassandra, Google Cloud BigTable, Apache HBase, and Redis.

## Types of NoSQL

> 1. Document databases
> 2. Key-value databases
> 3. Wide-column stores
> 4. Graph databases

## Usage of NoSQL

> - The document database is used to support real-time event-driven architecture.
> - Key-value storage is used for caching and microservice architecture.
> - While handling large sets of unstructured and unrelated data.
> - The graph database is used to analyze the relationships in the data.
